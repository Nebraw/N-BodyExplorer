The N-body problem involves solving Newton's equations of motion for N gravitationally interacting bodies, knowing their masses and initial positions and velocities.

This is a fundamental mathematical problem for classical astronomy, i.e. where the effects of general relativity can be neglected:
body velocities small compared to the speed of light in vacuum, and weak gravitational fields, which is essentially the case in the Solar System.


This project is a small cpp simulation of the interaction of several celestial bodies, allowing us to “recreate” the solar system.
How it works:
Make

./cppa files [files]*


Syntax config.txt file
SizeX SizeY SizeZ multi_gravit.

the config.txt file contains the display dimensions and then pattern the constant
as you see fit.

If no value is given for the multiplicative gravitational constant, it will be set to 1.
